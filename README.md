# MC3-PayrollTracker

## Description

The goal of this project was to write JavaScript code that completes the program, in this case being the functions necessary to take in user input and manipulate it. 

That 'manipulation' includes finding an average salary of a user-input list of objects, as well as choosing randomly from those objects to decide a 'winner' of some unspecified prize.

This project also helped me to familiarize myself with objects, their properties, and how to target said properties specifically, if need be. 

It's a cool little program.
